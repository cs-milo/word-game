# Wacky Word Game

## Overview
Wacky Word Game is a short Python program that creates a personalized poem based on words entered by the user. The program prompts the user for their name, adjectives, and nouns, then uses those inputs to generate a fun, customized poem.

This project was designed as an introductory exercise to practice user input, string concatenation, and program flow in Python. This was part of a three-part program lab, and was a lot of fun to create. The end result is a mad-libs style poem.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter their name.
- The program asks for a series of descriptive words (adjectives and plural nouns).
- Once all inputs are collected, the program prints a short poem using the provided words.
- The poem is personalized with the user’s name and chosen words.

## What I Learned
This project helped reinforce several foundational Python concepts:

- Collecting user input with the `input()` function
- Storing values in variables
- Combining strings and variables using concatenation
- Controlling the order of execution in a script
- Formatting output to improve readability

It also demonstrated how even simple programs can feel interactive and engaging when they respond directly to user input, shaping my personal view that user input can be the most important feature of one's project.
